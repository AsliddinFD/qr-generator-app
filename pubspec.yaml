# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SFProDisplay

        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display.ttf
          weight: 400
